                <p>Do you know where your money is going every month? If not, then that’s a huge mistake<br> that you are doing. Start to track your expenses Today.<br><br>

                    No Matter how much money you make, budgeting is the only way to keep control on,<br> your financial pattern. Often, people who are making a decent salary cannot get out of<br> the vicious cycle of living paycheck to paycheck — and the reason why is because they<br> are not tracking where all their money is going.

                <p>Now you will have a clear picture of the total money coming in and the money going out, you can start tracking your expenses and then create your budget based on what you should be spending on most.

                    The less you spend on the expenses you can control, the quicker you’ll get out of debt and/or be able to save more towards your goals.</p>

                <h2>2.   Calulate your total Expenses</h2>
                <p>Your first step towards saving money is finding out exactly how much you’re spending each month. You can do this by glancing your bank statements and bills. Add up everything you 
                    spent for the last six to 12 months and then divide by the amount of months, which will give you your average monthly expenses..
